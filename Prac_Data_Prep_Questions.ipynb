The expected outcome is \"clean\" data that can be directly fed into *any* machine learning algorithm within the Scikit-Learn Python module.

    "The UCI Machine Learning Repository provides five datasets, but only `adult.data`, `adult.test`, and `adult.names` were useful in this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `adult.data` and `adult.test` are the training and test datasets respectively. \n",
    "* `adult.names` contains the details of attributes or variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training dataset has 32,561 training observations. Meanwhile, the test dataset has 16,281 test observations. Both datasets consist of 14 descriptive features and one target feature called `income`. In this exercise, we combine both training and test data into one as part of data preprocessing. The target feature is defined as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{income} = \\begin{cases} > 50K & \\text{ if the income exceeds USD 50,000} \\\\ \\leq 50K & \\text{ otherwise }\\end{cases}$$\n",

    "The descriptive features below are produced from the `adult.names` file: \n",

    "* **`marital-status`**: Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse. \n",
    "* **`occupation`**: Tech-support, Craft-repair, Other-service, Sales, Exec-managerial, Prof-specialty, Handlers-cleaners, Machine-op-*inspct, Adm-clerical, Farming-fishing, Transport-moving, Priv-house-serv, Protective-serv, Armed-Forces.\n",

The weight is an “estimate of the number of units in the target population that the responding unit represents”.

    "In the previous exercises, we have performed heaps of data wrangling on target and categorical features. Let's focus on the continuous/numeric features: `age`, `capital-gain`, `capital-loss` and `hours-per-week`. Based on the summary statistics (in Exercise 2), `age` ranges 17 to 90 years old with a mean of 38.64. Therefore, we can conclude `age` has a reasonable range of values and hence requires no data wrangling. However, `hours-per-week` ranges from 1 to 99 hours with a mean of 40. We suspect 99 is used to label the \"missing\" instance of `hours-per-week`. On the other hand, it is still possible to work more than 90 hours per week. Therefore, we shall not preprocess it further. To check this, you can find the second largest value of `hours-per-week` is 98. Next, `capital-gain` ranges from 0 to 99,999 and we suspect that the missing observations are hence labeled as \"99999\". Is that true? We run the following code and find that a capital gain value of 99,999 always returns a higher income earner, we conjecture it might be a useful predictive value and hence we shall not remove the observations with this value.\n",
